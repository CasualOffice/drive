/**
 * SR15 — Playwright baseline for keystroke→paint latency.
 * Spec: docs/ux/12-search-surface.md §"Performance budget".
 *
 * The SPA's lib/searchMetrics.ts opens a measurement window on every
 * first-keystroke-after-paint and closes it in a double-rAF after
 * the search effect setStates the result pane. Stats are surfaced
 * on `window.__cd_search_perf()`.
 *
 * This spec types a few real queries against the demo backend, reads
 * the rolling buffer, and asserts:
 *   - At least one measurement landed (the wiring is connected).
 *   - p95 is under a 500 ms ceiling.
 *
 * Sized as ~2× the local baseline (Mac p95 ~240 ms) to absorb CI
 * variance. The spec target is 200 ms; we're not asserting tighter
 * yet because the demo backend adds ~50 ms over a real OpenSearch
 * round-trip and CI runners vary widely. If we see a few weeks of
 * green at <500 ms in CI, halve the ceiling.
